Deep Brain Stimulation Complication Risk Analysis
Background

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is widely used in movement disorders. Identifying predictors of postoperative complications is clinically relevant for patient selection and perioperative risk stratification.

Methods

A simulated dataset of 120 DBS patients was generated including demographic and clinical variables. A multivariate logistic regression model was performed to evaluate predictors of postoperative complications.

Statistical Approach

Multivariate logistic regression (glm, binomial)

Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals

Visualization using ggplot2

Results (Simulated Data)

Increasing age and longer disease duration were associated with higher probability of complications in the simulated model.
